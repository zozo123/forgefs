# Forge CLI machine contract

Automation must key on exit codes, not stderr wording.

| Exit | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 0 | success |
| 1 | denied/capability/input/not-found |
| 2 | corruption or sealed-state violation |
| 3 | transient busy/contention |
| 4 | stale observation or merge conflict |
| 5 | I/O, SQLite, or internal failure |

`--cap PATH|TOKEN` or `FORGE_CAP` is required for normal commands; ForgeFS has no ambient root authority.
